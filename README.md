# COM2025 coursework skeleton

## Getting started with the Django application
- From the command line, navigate to the `django-app` folder using `cd django-app`
- Install the dependencies by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - You may need to use a virtual environment using `venv` depending on your installation  
- Manage the application using the management tools with `python3 manage.py` 

Your API views must be placed in the `api_views.py` file, with templated user-facing routes  written in `views.py`. These will need importing as required in the subapp's `urls.py`.

- Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start the application by running `npm run start`
